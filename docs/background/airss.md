# Ab initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS)

Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS)[^1][^2] is an approach to
search for low energy structure by simply generating random structures,
followed by local optimisation. Local optimisation is a relatively
simple and mathematically well-established, it found a nearby local
minimum in the configuration space by simply going down-hill in energy.
The potential energy surface (PES) can be divided into many
basins-of-attraction. Performing a local optimisation inside a basin
would lead us to bottom of this basin, e.g. the local minimum.

From first glance, such random sampling approach is deemed to fail for
complex and high-dimensional configuration space due to the existence of
many high energy local minima, making the chance of landing in the basin
of attraction of the global minimum diminishing. However, one must not
forget that the potential energy surface (PES) is a physical quantity,
and hence their structure follow certain rules. While the number of high
energy local minima may be overwhelming, the chance of landing into a
basins-of-attraction is proportional to its hypervolume, and the lower
the energy, the larger the hypervolume, favouring even a random sampler.
In addition, we know that a large portion of the configuration space is
not likely to contain any low energy minima - the atoms the bonds
between them do have well-known finite sizes. The region of the PES
including atoms very close to each other are unlikely to have any low
energy minima, and hence can be excluded from sampling. Likewise,
structures with atoms far apart from each other should also be excluded
from sampling. With a few physical constraints, such as the species-wise
minimum separations, including symmetry operations, a simple random
search approach can be made highly efficient for locating the ground
state structure and other low energy polymorphs. While the structures
are *randomly* generated, the parameters controlling the generation
process are *not randomly chosen* - they are motivated by physical
reasons.

The phrase *ab initio* not only means that this approach **can** be used
with first-principles methods for energy evaluation, but also that it
**should** be used with them, since it is the physical nature of the PES
that is been exploited here. While random search can be applied with
parameterized interatomic potentials, the latter are unlikely to
reproduce the true PES especially in the region far away from fitted
phases. Hence, it is not a surprise if random search does not work well
in those cases.

A consequence of random sampling is that the computational workload can
be made fully parallel and distributed. There is no need to coordinate
the search as a whole, each worker can work independently little or no
inter-communication at all. In constrast, *global optimisation*
methods such as basin hopping, requires each calculation to be performed
in serial. Population based approaches such as genetic algorithms and
particle swarm optimisation allow certain degree of parallelism within a
single generation (tenth of structures), but each generation still have
to be evaluated iteratively.

This means that for random searching:

-   The underlying DFT calculations can be parallelised over only a few
    CPUs each, maximising the parallel efficiently which otherwise can
    drop sharply with increasing core counts.
-   The elimination of iterative process means there is no dilemma of
    *exploration or exploitation*.
-   A further consequence is that the DFT calculations can be performed
    at relatively low basis set qulaity and accuracy to maximise the
    speed, usually at several times lower in the cost compared to normal
    calculations.
-   In addition, most structures include and perserv symmetry operations
    throughout the process, which can be used to speed-up DFT
    calculations by several folds.

# The **AIRSS** package

The **AIRSS** package is a open-source collection of tools and scripts for
performing *ab initio* random structure searching (AIRSS) (which
confusinly has the same name), and analysing the results. The key
components of this package includes:

## `buildcell`

The main work horse for generating structures. This file reads a
input *seed* file from stdin and outputs generated structuer in
stdout. Both input and outputs files are in the CASTEP\'s `cell`
format, and the former contains special directives on how the random
Structure should be generated.

## `airss.pl`

The main driver script for performing the search. It read command
line arguments and performs random structure generation and runs DFT
calculations in serial, and stop until the specified number of
structure has been generated. Because the search is embarrsingly
parallel, one can just launch as many `airss.pl` as they like to
occupy all computational resources. For example, to sample 800
structure using 128 cores, one can launch 8 `airss.pl` script each
using 16 cores and sampling 100 structures. The result of `airss.pl`
are saved in the SHELX format with suffix `res`. These files
contains both the crystal structure and the calculated quantities.
While DISP does not use this script directly, it is recommanded
that the user familiarise themselves with operating AIRSS using
it.

## `cryan`

A tool to analyse the relaxed structures. It can be used to rank
structures according to energy as well as eliminating nearly
identical structures and extracting species-wise minimum distances.
It also has many other advanced features as such decomposing a
structure into modular units.

## `cabal`

A tool for convert different file formats. It is used internally by
various scripts. One very useful feature is to convert file into
SHELX format so they can be processed by `cryan`.

## `castep_relax`

The driver script for performing geometry optimisation using CASTEP.
The use of this script is needed because CASTEP defaults to
constant-cut off energy variable cell optionsation. For
high-throughput operation the more traditional constant basis
optimisation is more efficeint, but t requires multiple restarts to
reach convergence. This script does exactly this jobs - it restarts
CASTEP relaxation up to defined iterations or until the converged is
reached twice in succession. This script is used by DISP to
perform CASTEP relaxations.

# Comparing with **AIRSS** package
**DISP** extends the search ability in AIRSS to allow a
client-server based workflow for directing massive parallel search at
run time. The AIRSS package must be installed on **both** the local
and the remote machines. Similar to the `airss.pl` script, the
`castep_relax` script is invoked for relaxation with CASTEP in DISP.
The output file is stored in the SHELX format that is compatible with
the `cryan` tool. The input and output files used here are aimed to be
fully compatible with the original AIRSS package.
