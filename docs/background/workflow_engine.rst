=========
Fireworks
=========

`Fireworks`_ is the workflow engine that DISP uses to deploy searches.
Its fully documentation can be found in its own website.
For simple search and retrieve type of work, knowing how to work with fireworks is not required.
However, detailed analytics and updating existing search jobs requires using the `lpad` command line interface, 
or the `LaunchPad` python interface of fireworks.



=======
MongoDB
=======

MongoDB is a NSQL database that `fireworks`_ uses as a centralised server that each *worker* pulls jobs from.
DISP also uses MongoDB to store relaxed geometry generated by the search.
Knowledge of MongoDB is required for advanced usages.

The quickest way to launch an MongoDB server on your own computer is to launch it throgh `docker`_.
Free public internet server is avaliable from the `MongoDB Atlas`_ service.
However, the free tier impose many limitations, and you may want to run a virtual private server (VPS) for MongoDB service yourselves.
